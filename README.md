# Python_Challenge

This assignment consisted of two parts: PyBank and PyPoll. I found that I could partially explain what was required in the codes. I will admit that I was more confident of myself and my abilities than I truly am. I would reiterate my thought process to the limited help I sought out, to see if I was making sense in how I wanted the code to work. 

## PyBank
I found this part to be the easier of the two, as I believe it was more straightforward than the other part. I was able to replicate the outcome, as shown in the instructions, and had little to no issues reading the data from the .csv file and writing the output into a .csv file.

## PyPoll
Conceptually, I believed that I could do this one all by myself. I certainly struggled and reached out to various forms of help. I believe I was on the right track to replicate the outcome; however, I was stumped on what specific functions to use and how to properly dictate the results I wanted. I realize that it is incomplete, so I left my thought process, as notes, in the code. I also mocked up how I wanted the output .csv file to write into the correct folder.
